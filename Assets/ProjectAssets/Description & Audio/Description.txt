Mouse
A mouse typically consists of a small, handheld device that is moved across a flat surface to move the cursor on the screen. It usually has two or more buttons that can be clicked to perform various actions, such as selecting items or opening menus.

Mice may also have additional features, such as scroll wheels for navigating documents or web pages, and programmable buttons for customizing shortcuts or macros. Overall, the mouse is an essential tool for navigating and interacting with modern computer systems

CPU
CPU stands for Central Processing Unit, which is the primary component of a computer that executes instructions and performs arithmetic, logical, and input/output operations. It is also known as the processor or the brain of the computer.

The CPU is responsible for fetching instructions from memory, decoding them, and executing them. It contains one or more processing cores that work together to carry out these tasks. The CPU communicates with other parts of the computer, such as memory and input/output devices, through buses that transfer data and control signals.

Headphones
Headphones are a type of personal audio equipment that are worn over the ears to listen to audio content, such as music, podcasts, or other forms of audio. They typically consist of two ear cups that are connected by a headband or wire, and they use small speakers called drivers to convert electrical signals into sound waves that can be heard by the listener. Headphones can be wired or wireless, and they come in a variety of styles and designs, including over-ear, on-ear, and in-ear models.

Monitor
A monitor is a visual display unit that is used to display text, images, and video output from a computer or other electronic device. It is sometimes also referred to as a screen, display, or visual display unit (VDU). Monitors come in various sizes, resolutions, and technologies, and can be either standalone or integrated into a device such as a laptop or tablet.

Processor
A processor, also known as a central processing unit (CPU), is the primary component of a computer system responsible for carrying out instructions and performing calculations. It is often referred to as the "brain" of the computer.The processor is a small chip that is located on the motherboard of the computer and contains millions of transistors.

RAM
"Ram" is an acronym for Random Access Memory. It is a type of computer memory that allows data to be stored and retrieved randomly, rather than in a sequential manner. RAM is a volatile memory, which means that its contents are lost when the power to the computer is turned off. RAM is used by the computer's processor to store data temporarily while it is being processed, and it plays a vital role in the overall performance of a computer. The amount of RAM a computer has can affect its speed and ability to run multiple programs simultaneously.

Water-Cooling Fan
A water-cooling fan is a type of cooling system used in computer hardware, particularly in high-performance gaming PCs and servers, to dissipate the heat generated by the central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU).
A water-cooling system typically consists of a water block that is attached to the CPU and GPU, a pump to circulate water, a radiator to dissipate heat from the water, and a fan to push air through the radiator.

Motherboard
A motherboard, also known as a mainboard or system board, is a printed circuit board (PCB) that serves as the central hub of a computer system. It connects all of the computer's hardware components, including the CPU (central processing unit), RAM (random access memory), storage devices, expansion cards, and peripherals such as the keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

Hard drive
A hard drive, also known as a hard disk drive (HDD), is a type of computer storage device that uses spinning disks to store and retrieve digital data. The disks are coated with a magnetic material and data is read and written onto the disks using read/write heads that move across the spinning disks.
Hard drives are typically used to store the operating system, applications, files, and other data on a computer. They are a type of non-volatile memory, meaning that the data remains stored even when the computer is turned off.

Graphic Card
A graphics card, also known as a video card or GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), is a hardware component that is responsible for rendering images, videos, and other graphical elements on a computer screen. The graphics card contains a specialized processor that is optimized for performing the complex calculations necessary for rendering high-quality graphics. The graphics card also includes dedicated memory, which is used to store the graphical data before it is displayed on the screen. The quality and speed of a graphics card can have a significant impact on the overall performance and visual quality of a computer.

SSD
SSD stands for Solid State Drive, which is a type of storage device used in computers and other electronic devices. Unlike traditional hard disk drives (HDD), which use spinning disks and read/write heads to access data, SSDs use flash memory chips to store and retrieve data. This makes SSDs faster, more reliable, and less susceptible to damage from physical shock or vibration than HDDs. SSDs are commonly used in laptops, desktops, and servers, as well as in other devices such as smartphones, tablets, and gaming consoles.

ROM
ROM stands for "Read-Only Memory." It is a type of computer memory that is used to store permanent data that cannot be altered or modified once it has been written. Unlike random access memory (RAM), which is volatile and requires power to retain its data, ROM is non-volatile and retains its data even when the power is turned off.                                       
There are several types of ROM, including mask ROM (MROM), programmable read-only memory (PROM), erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and flash memory.
